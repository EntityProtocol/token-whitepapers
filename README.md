## Voting process

Active votes are listed in [open issues](https://github.com/PublicDatasets/token-whitepapers/issues). To vote, simply leave üëç if you agree that the action sufficiently meets the criteria (see: `Criteria of a good submission`) to be added to whitepapers.csv, and üëé if not.

If you want to add a token symbol is already claimed by another project, add an underscore numerical tag (ex: gnt and gnt_1)

We want to make this a community resource and welcome all suggestions. Open an issue to discuss if you have an idea for a new criteria.
